# NeoVim Pure Black 

Only works with [NvChad](https://nvchad.github.io/).

This configuration made explicitly to adapt NeoVim to my Archcraft BSPWM configuration:
https://github.com/ozanyetkin/archcraft-bspwm-theme


This is intended for personal use. But feel free to use it!

# ⚙️ installation

  1. `git clone https://github.com/ozanyetkin/nvim-black-theme.git`

  2. `mv custom ~/.config/nvim/lua/`
  
  **Warning:** If you already have a custom directory, just move the themes directory, and modify your chadrc.lua & plugins/inited.lua accordingly!
